<HTML><BODY>After George B. Thayers story of cycling across the US on a penny-farthing (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49474">49474</a>); now a couple who take it to an even further extreme: cycling around the world. This book follows the Mr. and Mrs. H. Darwin McIlrath while they cycle from Chicago, through China, Burma, India, and the Middle East upto Munich (after which the story stops). As the previous book, written as installments for publication in a newspaper, and collected into a book afterwards.
